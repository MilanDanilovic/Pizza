recipe for all who want to try it
595grams of flour (Tipo 00 flour)
386grams Of water (cool temperature)
18 grams of salt
One teaspoon of dry yeast or a quarter of fresh yeast block

If you donâ€™t have tipo 00 flour use type 405 which is very similar but little less water.

Important: mix the flour and salt because yeast hates salt. Let the yeast dissolve in the water and then put it slowly in the flour to mix it well and then knead. I only can recommend a technique to knead it correctly.

Let it rest in a bowl for 3 hours but cover it with a wet kitchen blanket to keep the dough humid. That is very important to prevent it from drying
